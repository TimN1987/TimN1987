## Hi there 👋

**TimN1987/TimN1987** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ecperimenting with C# and Python projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Winforms and WPF with C# and linking in SQL.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can learn from others.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making my code tidier, clearer and more efficient.
