## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I have begun learning computer programming as part of a plan to change careers.
I have quickly learned that I should have started years ago!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ecperimenting with C# and Python projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Winforms and WPF with C# and linking in SQL.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can learn from others.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making my code tidier, clearer and more efficient.
